# MVNgeodesics
This package is a companion for the publication *The Fisher Geometry and Geodesics of the Multivariate Normals, without Differential Geometry*.
**Code written by:** Brodie Lawson
**Project by:** Brodie Lawson, Kerrie Mengersen, Rodrigo Weber dos Santos and Kevin Burrage.

Included are a variety of functions, implemented in MATLAB (sorry), that find paths and (Fisher--Rao) distances in the space of multivariate normals (MVNs), including visualisation of these objects.
Given the unavailability of closed-form solutions for Fisher geodesics (or their lengths) in the space of MVNs, potentially most useful are the functions for numerically finding these:
    onePointShooting.m    multiPointShooting.m    multiPointShootingAdaptive.m

Included in this package are the codes used to generate the figures included in the paper.
